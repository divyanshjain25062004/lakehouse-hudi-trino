# Local Lakehouse with Hudi, MinIO, Hive Metastore, and Trino

This repository provisions a self-contained lakehouse environment for experimenting with Apache Hudi over MinIO storage and querying the data through Trino. The stack mirrors the architecture described in the assignment brief and ships with an ingestion job that reshapes the public Johns Hopkins COVID-19 dataset into a Hudi table.

## 1. Windows 11 + VS Code Walkthrough

The project runs entirely in Docker containers, so the recommended Windows 11 workflow is to use Docker Desktop with WSL 2 and Visual Studio Code. The following steps assume you have administrator rights on the machine.

1. **Install Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2)**
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
     ```powershell
     wsl --install
     ```
   - Restart when prompted. This installs the default Ubuntu distribution, which Docker Desktop and VS Code can target.
   - Launch the Ubuntu app once so it can finish the first-time setup and create your Linux user.

2. **Install Docker Desktop for Windows**
   - Download it from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/ and run the installer.
   - During setup, enable the options for *Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V* and *Add shortcut to desktop*.
   - After installation, open Docker Desktop → **Settings → Resources → WSL Integration** and switch on integration for the Ubuntu distribution created in the previous step.
   - Confirm Docker is working inside WSL by opening the Ubuntu terminal and running `docker --version`.

3. **Install Visual Studio Code with Remote Extensions**
   - Install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/.
   - Launch VS Code and install the following extensions:
     * *WSL* (ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl)
     * *Docker* (ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) – optional but helpful for monitoring containers
   - From the VS Code Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), choose **WSL: Connect to WSL using Distro...** and select Ubuntu. VS Code will reopen connected to the Linux environment.

4. **Clone the repository inside WSL**
   - In the VS Code integrated terminal (now pointing at Ubuntu), run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/lakehouse-hudi-trino.git
     cd lakehouse-hudi-trino
     ```
   - Ensure the persistent directories exist: `mkdir -p data/raw data/minio data/postgres`.

5. **Download dependencies from WSL**
   - Fetch the COVID-19 dataset:
     ```bash
     curl -L \
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv \
       -o data/raw/covid19.csv
     ```
   - Download the supporting JARs (requires Maven Central access):
     ```bash
     ./scripts/bootstrap_jars.sh
     ```

6. **Start the Docker stack from VS Code’s terminal**
   - Bring the services up:
     ```bash
     docker compose up -d minio postgres hive-metastore trino spark
     ```
   - Watch the logs if needed: `docker compose logs -f`.
   - Validate container health: `docker compose ps`.

7. **Run the Spark ingestion job**
   - Execute the helper script (still inside WSL):
     ```bash
     ./scripts/run_ingest.sh
     ```
   - The script runs `spark-submit` inside the `spark` container and will register the `default.covid19` table in Hive Metastore.

8. **Query the data with Trino**
   - Open the Trino CLI inside the container:
     ```bash
     docker compose exec trino trino --catalog hive --schema default
     ```
   - Paste the assignment queries (they are also saved in [`trino/queries/covid19_exploration.sql`](trino/queries/covid19_exploration.sql)).
   - Optionally, browse to http://localhost:8080 in your Windows browser to use the Trino web UI.

9. **Stop services when finished**
   - In VS Code’s terminal:
     ```bash
     docker compose down
     ```
   - Remove persisted volumes if you want a clean slate: `rm -rf data/minio data/postgres`.

> **Tip:** Because the repo lives inside the WSL filesystem, file changes made in VS Code sync directly to the Linux environment that Docker sees, avoiding path-mapping issues between Windows and Linux.



* Docker and Docker Compose v2
* ~4 GB free disk space for containers, the dataset, and local object storage
* A stable internet connection to download Docker images and the Spark package dependencies

Create the directories that will hold persistent volumes (Git keeps them via `.gitkeep` files):

```bash
mkdir -p data/raw data/minio data/postgres
```

Download the COVID-19 dataset (wide format) into `data/raw/covid19.csv`. You can fetch the Johns Hopkins CSSE file directly:

```bash
curl -L \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv \
  -o data/raw/covid19.csv
```

Populate the `jars/` directory with the helper dependencies required by Hive Metastore and Spark (the Docker Compose file mounts
them into Hive's `HIVE_AUX_JARS_PATH` and the Spark driver's extra classpath):

Populate the `jars/` directory with the helper dependencies required by Hive Metastore and Spark:


```bash
./scripts/bootstrap_jars.sh
```

This downloads the Apache Hudi bundles along with the Hadoop AWS, AWS SDK, and Postgres JDBC drivers so that the Docker
containers have every dependency available from the host volume without fetching artifacts at runtime.

## 3. Boot the Lakehouse Services

---

## 2. Boot the Lakehouse Services

Start the core services (MinIO, Postgres, Hive Metastore, and Trino):

```bash
docker compose up -d minio postgres hive-metastore trino
```

Verify that the containers are healthy:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

Useful URLs:

* MinIO console: http://localhost:9001 (user: `minio`, password: `minio123`)
* Trino web UI: http://localhost:8080 (no authentication)

## 4. Run the Spark → Hudi Ingestion Job

The ingestion job lives in `ingest/spark_hudi_ingest.py`. It reads the wide CSV dataset, normalises it to a long format, enriches it with Hudi metadata, and writes a Copy-On-Write Hudi table to MinIO while registering the table in Hive Metastore.

Submit the job entirely through Docker using the helper script (it resolves the downloaded JARs and injects them into the Spark container automatically):

```bash
./scripts/run_ingest.sh
```

The script ensures the dataset exists, verifies that all supporting JARs are available, and then runs `spark-submit` inside the Docker container using the mounted volumes. On success you should see a log similar to:

## 3. Run the Spark → Hudi Ingestion Job

The ingestion job lives in `ingest/spark_hudi_ingest.py`. It reads the wide CSV dataset, normalises it to a long format, enriches it with Hudi metadata, and writes a Copy-On-Write Hudi table to MinIO while registering the table in Hive Metastore.

Submit the job through the Spark container with the required dependencies provided via Maven coordinates:

```bash
docker compose run --rm \
  -e COVID19_RAW_PATH=/data/raw/covid19.csv \
  -e HUDI_OUTPUT_PATH=s3a://hudi-datasets/covid19 \
  spark \
  /opt/bitnami/spark/bin/spark-submit \
    --master local[2] \
    --packages \
org.apache.hudi:hudi-spark3.3-bundle_2.12:0.14.0,org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.4,com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-bundle:1.12.262,org.postgresql:postgresql:42.7.3 \
    --conf spark.sql.hive.convertMetastoreParquet=false \
    --conf spark.sql.catalogImplementation=hive \
    ingest/spark_hudi_ingest.py
```

The command mounts the repository inside the container (see `docker-compose.yml`), so the script and dataset are directly accessible. On success you should see a log similar to:


```
✅ Ingest complete: default.covid19 registered with 2,000+ rows.
```

The table will be available under the `s3a://hudi-datasets/covid19` prefix inside MinIO.


## 4. Query the Data in Trino

With the ingestion complete, open the Trino CLI within the container to query the dataset:

```bash
docker compose exec trino trino --catalog hive --schema default
```
Sample queries (also available in [`trino/queries/covid19_exploration.sql`](trino/queries/covid19_exploration.sql)):

Sample queries:


```sql
SHOW TABLES;

SELECT country, reportdate, confirmed
FROM covid19
WHERE country = 'Italy' AND reportdate BETWEEN DATE '2020-03-01' AND DATE '2020-03-07'
ORDER BY reportdate;

SELECT country, MAX(confirmed) AS peak_confirmed
FROM covid19
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY peak_confirmed DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

You can also browse http://localhost:8080 to issue the same queries via the Trino web UI.

## 6. Tear Down


When finished, stop the environment:

```bash
docker compose down
```

If you want a clean slate, remove the persisted volumes as well:

```bash
rm -rf data/minio data/postgres s3-data
```

---

## 7. Project Structure


```
├── docker-compose.yml        # Defines MinIO, Postgres, Hive Metastore, Trino, Spark services
├── ingest/
│   └── spark_hudi_ingest.py  # Spark job for ingesting the COVID-19 dataset into Hudi
├── scripts/
│   ├── bootstrap_jars.sh     # Downloads the dependency jars into ./jars for Docker to mount
│   └── run_ingest.sh         # Runs the Spark ingestion job through docker compose
└── trino/
    ├── catalog/
    │   └── hive.properties   # Hive connector configuration pointing to MinIO & Hive Metastore
    └── queries/
        └── covid19_exploration.sql  # Ready-to-run SQL snippets for Trino

```

Happy querying! If you encounter issues, double-check that all services are healthy and that the dataset/JAR downloads completed successfully.
